# stablecoin-multihub-project

## Background
- Currently, stablecoins are being issued in major economic zones, such as the Japanese yen, US dollar, and euro.
- In the future, stablecoins are likely to handle a portion of real-world currency exchange and remittance demand.
- At real demand scale, supporting hundreds of millions of dollars in liquidity is not something a single individual, investor, or company can realistically carry.
- In a blockchain environment where assets can be exchanged freely, there is no strict requirement for the US dollar to be the central hub
  for all stablecoin exchanges.

## What this is not
- Not a fundraising project
- Not a token sale
- Not a custodial service


## What you can participate
- Provide liquidity for direct stablecoin pairs on DEXs
- Share information about newly issued national stablecoins
- Observe, use, and critique the network openly

## Merit
- Real demand for currency exchange and remittance already exists
- A multi-hub structure can reduce costs and unnecessary routing
- Liquidity grows through participation rather than central control

## Current experiment
- Chain: Polygon
- Pair: xSGD / JPYC
- Size: ~100 USD (small-scale personal experiment)
- Status: Planned
